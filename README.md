Analysis of Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) Activity with  Demographic and Economic Implications
When faced with the task of analyzing nearly eight million rows of reporting information on LAPD activity and the City of LA’s demographic
and economic history, Apache Pig is an effective tool for extracting, transforming, and loading the data. Apache Pig allows for the 
database management and enables for the writing of complex data transformation using high-level MapReduce programming. 

The bulk of the data is derived from LAPD activity, which is split into three datasets. The three datasets are vehicle and pedestrian 
stops, crimes, and arrests information originally collected for purposes of police reporting. The remainder of the data is on LA’s
demographic, economic, and census history.  The datasets were collected from government open source. Analysis is made along field relations
within a single dataset and across multiple datasets in order to discover unique insights that can be applied to other cities with similar
data.

The analysis accomplishes unique insights into police activity and city awareness.  It continues the on the key themes of public safety,
open transparency, accountability, civic engagement, public benefit from government open source, integrity of services, and public
resilience. Limitations of analysis are included along with research details and findings.
